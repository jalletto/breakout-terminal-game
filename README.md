Work in progress.. 

Trying to make a game that runs in the terminal. Specifically [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) using the Python [Curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) library. 

Follow my blog about how I am barely accomplishing this [here](https://medium.com/@joshalletto/how-to-make-a-shitty-game-you-can-play-in-the-terminal-part-one-a-bouncing-ball-554bf75bc648)
